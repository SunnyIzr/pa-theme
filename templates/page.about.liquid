    <h2>About Paul Andrew</h2>
    <p>A designer of relentless curiosity and invention, Paul Andrew finds inspiration in eclectic places: modern art, classic film, exotic cities ‐ but above all, the individual who wears his shoes. Passionate about the incomparable fit of handmade footwear, Paul believes that luxury cannot exist without comfort.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Paul’s singular vision is informed by his extensive fashion pedigree, cultivated within iconic fashion houses, such as Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Narciso Rodriguez and Alexander McQueen. In 2013, he launched his namesake collection, and propelled by the support of his design mentors and relationships with the finest manufacturers in Italy, Paul Andrew took the industry by storm. Just two years later, in 2014, Paul won the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, becoming the first footwear designer to receive the top honor.</p>
    <p class='hide additional-about'>His fascination with the interplay of fabric and form began at a very early age in England, where his father was the upholsterer to the Queen at Windsor Castle. Surrounded by the rich fabrics in his father’s workshop, Paul was inspired to study Fashion Design at University. After winning "Footwear Designer Of The Year" at London's Graduate Fashion Week, he went on to work alongside giants of the industry, to whom he credits his unique set of technical skills.</p>
    <p class='hide additional-about'>Today, Paul Andrew footwear is carried by the most prestigious fashion boutiques worldwide. His celebrity fans are also his muses: Jessica Chastain, Lupita Nyong’o and Cate Blanchett have stepped out in his stilettos, representing the epitome of the Paul Andrew woman: talented, thoughtful, and utterly elegant.</p>

      <h2>ELEMENTS OF DESIGN</h2> 
      <p>
        “Footwear requires both a keen eye for proportion, color, and decoration, 
        but also the constant attention to comfort, fit, and performance."

    <ol class='design-list'>
      <li>Triple dyed suede creates saturated color, but also means it’s more durable and longer lasting.</li>
      <li>Not only is the wing detail beautiful but also holds the foot in the pump.</li>
      <li>The inclination of the arch is specifically designed for the modern foot, making it one of the most comfortable on the market.</li>
      <li>The Insole is lined with industrial memory foam making it easier to wear for longer hours.</li>
      <li>The underslung heel balances the weight of the body perfectly. </li>
      <li>The resin heel contains a steel pin which means that even on the higher stilettos the heel still feels strong and secure.</li>
